 *  Extra 5-1 Calculate the factorial of a number
 *  =============================================
 *  In this exercise, you'll create Extra5-1Console
 *  and Extra5-1GUI that accepts an integer from the
 *  user and then calculates the factorial of that
 *  integer.
 *  
 *  The factorial of a # is an integer multiplied by
 *  every positive integer less than itself.
 *  
 *  A factorial number is identified by an 
 *  exclamation point following the number.
 *  
 *  Here's how you calculate the factorial of the 
 *  numbers 1 through 5:
 *  
 *  1! = 1 which equals 1 
 *  2! = 2 * 1 which equals 2
 *  3! = 3 * 2 * 1 which equals 6 
 *  4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 which equals 24 
 *  5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 which equals 120
 *  
 *  To be able to store the large integer values 
 *  for the factorial, this app can't use the 
 *  Int32 data type.
 *  
 *  1.	GUI Only
 *   	Create an event handler for the Click 
 *   	event of the Calculate button. The event 
 *   	handler should get the number the user 
 *   	enters, calculate the factorial of that
 *   	number, display the factorial with commas 
 *   	but	no decimal places, and move the focus 
 *   	to the Number text box. It should return 
 *   	an accurate value for integers from 1 to 20.
 *   	
 *   2. Create an event handler for the Click event 
 *      of the Exit button that closes the form.
 *
 *  3.  Test the app to be sure it works correctly.
