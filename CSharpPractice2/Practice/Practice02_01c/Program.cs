/*
 *      Extra 4-2 Accumulate test score data
 *      ====================================
 *      In this exercise, you'll create a form that 
 *      accepts one or more scores from the user.
 *      
 *      Each time a score is added, the score total, 
 *      score count, and average score are calculated 
 *      and displayed.
 *      
 *      1.	Create Extra4-2Console and Extra4-2GUI.
 *      
 *      2.	Declare two class variables to store the 
 *			score total and the score count.
 *		
 *		3. 	GUI Only
 *			Create an event handler for the Click 
 *			event of the Add button. The event handler 
 *			should get the score the user enters, 
 *			calculate and display the score total,
 *			score count, and average score, and move 
 *			the focus to the Score text box. It should 
 *			provide for integer entries, but you can 
 *			assume that the user will enter valid 
 *			integer values.
 *			
 *		4. 	GUI Only:
 *			Create an event handler for the Click 
 *			event of the  Clear button. The event 
 *			handler should set the two class 
 *			variables to zero, clear the text boxes 
 *			on the form, and move the focus to the 
 *			Score text box.
 *			
 *		5.	GUI Only:
 *			Create an event handler for the Click
 *			event of the Exit button that closes 
 *			the form.
 *			
 *		6.	Test the app to be sure it works correctly.
